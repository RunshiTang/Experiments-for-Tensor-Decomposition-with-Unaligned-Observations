# Experiments-for-Tensor-Decomposition-with-Unaligned-Observations

In this repository, we provide the code scripts used to create the results in the following paper: 

Runshi Tang, Tamara Kolda, and Anru R. Zhang. Tensor Decomposition with Unaligned Observations

# Reproducing Experiments

## Setup

Requires R (only used to generate simulation data), Python3.11, and Python libraries imported in the scripts. 
The working directories and file paths in the scripts need to be adjusted accordingly to run the scripts. 
The experiments are performed on Winstat for big jobs and Slurm of the Social Science Computing Cooperative of UW-Madison. 

## Contents

### Simulation Study

*All the files are in the directory `simulation/`. 

*`generate5.R` is used to generate the data used for this simulation study. 

*`simulation/rkhs` includes the files used for the simulation study involving RKHS-TD and S-RKHS-TD in the paper.
