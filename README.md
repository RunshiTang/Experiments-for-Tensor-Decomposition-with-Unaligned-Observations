In this repository, we provide the code scripts used to create the results in the following paper: 

Runshi Tang, Tamara Kolda, and Anru R. Zhang. Tensor Decomposition with Unaligned Observations

# Reproducing Experiments

## Setup

Requires Python3.11 and Python libraries imported in the scripts. 
The working directories and file paths in the scripts need to be adjusted accordingly to run the scripts. 
The experiments are performed on Winstat for big jobs and Slurm of the Social Science Computing Cooperative of UW-Madison.
